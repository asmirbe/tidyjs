Task: Fixing the Dynamic Imports Issue

*Context:*  
The code is breaking dynamic imports, which is not expected. This happens because a CSS import (i.e., `import '../../style.css';`) appears after a dynamic import. The CSS import is getting formatted along with the dynamic imports, causing problems. We need to modify the behavior so that this CSS import is ignored or not formatted after the dynamic imports.

*Code Snippet:*
```jsx
// Misc
import React        from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import type { FC }  from 'react';

const DynamicComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./DynamicComponent'));
const module = await import('./dynamicModule');

import '../../style.css';

const DynamicImports: FC = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setState(state + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <DynamicComponent />
    </div>
  );
};
```

*Tasks:*

1. **Analyze the Problem:**  
   - Review the code snippet and explain why the dynamic imports are breaking.
   - Describe how the placement of `import '../../style.css';` after the dynamic import is causing the issue.

2. **Explain the Issue in Simple Terms:**  
   - Summarize in plain language why the dynamic import is being formatted incorrectly.
   - Explain the impact of this formatting issue on the code functionality.

3. **Identify the Problematic Import:**  
   - Clearly point out that the CSS import (`import '../../style.css';`) is the source of the formatting issue.
   - Explain why its position in the code is problematic.

4. **Propose a Fix:**  
   - Modify the code or add necessary configuration so that the CSS import is ignored after the dynamic imports.
   - Provide clear instructions or code changes that will prevent the formatter from interfering with the dynamic imports.

5. **Provide the Corrected Code:**  
   - Present the updated code snippet with the fix applied.
   - Ensure the code is formatted correctly and that dynamic imports work as expected without being affected by the CSS import.
