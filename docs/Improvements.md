Several potential improvements that could be made to the code in formatter.ts:

1. Performance Optimizations
Memoization for Repeated Operations: Functions like getEffectiveLengthForSorting could benefit from memoization since they might be called multiple times with the same inputs during sorting.

Reduce Redundant AST Parsing: The code creates multiple TypeScript source files (sourceFile, cleanedSourceFile) which is expensive. Consider refactoring to reuse the AST when possible.

Optimize Regex Operations: The regex patterns, especially sectionCommentRegex, are complex and executed repeatedly. Consider compiling them once outside the function.

2. Code Structure Improvements
Modularization: Break down large functions like findAllImportsRange into smaller, more focused functions with single responsibilities.

Configuration Injection: Instead of using global variables like IMPORT_GROUPS and ALIGNMENT_SPACING, consider passing them as parameters to make functions more testable and pure.

Type Safety: Add more explicit TypeScript interfaces for intermediate data structures to improve type safety and documentation.

3. Algorithm Improvements
Import Section Detection: The current algorithm in findAllImportsRange is complex and potentially fragile. Consider a more robust approach that relies more heavily on the TypeScript AST rather than string manipulation and regex.

Simplify Grouping Logic: The nested Maps in groupImportsOptimized make the code harder to follow. Consider a flatter data structure or a more functional approach.

Alignment Algorithm: The current approach in alignImportsBySection has edge cases with multi-line imports. A more robust approach might use the AST to understand the structure better.

4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
Better Error Handling: Add more robust error handling, especially for edge cases in import formatting.

Handle Comments More Robustly: The current comment handling logic has edge cases, especially with inline comments or comments between imports.

Defensive Programming: Add more null checks and defensive programming techniques, especially when working with the TypeScript AST.

5. Maintainability Improvements
Documentation: Add more comprehensive JSDoc comments, especially explaining the algorithms and their edge cases.

Unit Tests: The complex algorithms would benefit from comprehensive unit tests to ensure they handle all edge cases correctly.

Constants Extraction: Move magic strings and numbers (like the 50 in firstStart - commentEnd < 50) to named constants.
