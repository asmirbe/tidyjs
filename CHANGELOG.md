## [Unreleased]

### üêõ Fixed

#### Path Resolution for Aliases Without Special Prefix
- **Fixed pathResolution ignoring aliases without @ or ~ prefix** - imports like `"utils"` are now correctly recognized and converted when configured as aliases in tsconfig.json/vite.config.js
- **Path resolver now checks alias mappings before rejecting** - the early rejection of imports not starting with `.`, `@`, or `~` has been moved after checking if they match configured aliases
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for alias pattern matching and edge cases
- **Enhanced logic** to properly distinguish between actual external modules (react, lodash) and configured path aliases (utils, lib, etc.)

#### TypeScript baseUrl Support
- **Fixed tsConfigLoader ignoring baseUrl when paths is not defined** - when tsconfig.json has `"baseUrl": "src"` without explicit `paths`, TidyJS now creates a wildcard mapping to resolve all non-relative imports
- **Added file existence validation** - path resolver now checks if the resolved file exists before converting, preventing false conversions of npm packages (e.g., `react` won't be converted to `../../react` if `src/react` doesn't exist)
- **Smart filtering for node_modules** - paths resolving to `node_modules` are automatically skipped
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 9 new tests covering baseUrl scenarios, including monorepo configurations and edge cases
- **Enhanced mock VS Code Uri.joinPath** - improved test infrastructure for better path resolution testing

#### Path Resolution Regrouping (Critical Fix)
- **Fixed imports requiring double format to be correctly grouped** - path resolution now happens BEFORE import grouping, ensuring converted imports are immediately placed in the correct group
- **Single format operation** - imports like `"utils"` ‚Üí `"../../utils"` are now converted AND correctly grouped in one operation instead of two
- **Unified path resolution logic** - both "absolute" and "relative" modes now use the same `applyPathResolutionWithRegrouping` function
- **Correct group assignment** - converted imports are re-evaluated with `determineGroup()` to ensure proper placement
- **Example:** Previously, `import { x } from 'utils'` in group "Misc" ‚Üí first format converts to `'../../utils'` but stays in "Misc" ‚Üí second format moves to "DS". Now: single format converts AND moves to "DS" immediately

#### Path Resolution Critical Bugs (Security & Correctness)
- **[High] Fixed multiple wildcards in alias patterns (resolveAliasToPathWithFallbacks)** - patterns like `@shop/*/widgets/*` now correctly capture and replace each wildcard separately instead of using the first capture for all wildcards. Changed from greedy `(.*)` to non-greedy `(.*?)` matching and sequential replacement with proper capture index tracking
- **[High] Fixed multiple wildcards in convertToAbsolute** - when converting relative paths to aliases (mode: "absolute"), patterns with multiple wildcards like `@shop/*/widgets/*` now correctly replace each wildcard with its corresponding capture. Previously `../../shop/products/widgets/inventory` ‚Üí `@shop/products/widgets/products` ‚ùå, now ‚Üí `@shop/products/widgets/inventory` ‚úÖ
- **[High] Fixed file extensions in relative‚Üíalias conversion** - when converting relative paths to aliases (mode: "absolute"), file extensions (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.d.ts`) are now properly stripped from the resulting alias path. Previously `../../components/Button.ts` ‚Üí `@app/components/Button.ts` ‚ùå, now ‚Üí `@app/components/Button` ‚úÖ. This ensures generated import statements match TypeScript/ES module conventions
- **[Medium] Fixed path fallback support** - when `tsconfig.json` defines multiple fallback paths (e.g., `["src/types/*", "generated/types/*", "@types/*"]`), all paths are now tried in order instead of only the first one, returning the first path that actually exists on disk
- **[Low] Fixed type-only alias directories** - added `/index.d.ts` to file existence checks, allowing purely type-level alias directories to be correctly resolved (previously skipped because only `.d.ts` was checked, not `/index.d.ts`)
- **New function `resolveAliasToPathWithFallbacks`** - replaces the old `resolveAliasToPath` with proper fallback iteration and existence checking
- **27 new tests** covering multiple wildcards (both directions), fallback scenarios, type-only packages, and extension stripping in alias conversion

## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-19

### ‚ú® Added

#### Automatic Path Resolution
- **New path resolution feature** to automatically convert between relative and absolute (aliased) imports
- **Support for multiple build tools**: TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), Vite (`vite.config.js/ts`), and Webpack (`webpack.config.js/ts`)
- **Bidirectional conversion modes**:
  - `mode: "relative"` - Converts absolute/aliased imports to relative paths
  - `mode: "absolute"` - Converts relative imports to absolute paths with aliases
- **Smart alias detection** that automatically finds and uses path mappings from your build configuration
- **Configuration options**:
  - `tidyjs.pathResolution.enabled` - Enable/disable the feature (default: false)
  - `tidyjs.pathResolution.mode` - Choose conversion mode (default: "relative")
  - `tidyjs.pathResolution.preferredAliases` - Control which aliases to use when multiple options exist. For example, if your config has `@/*`, `@app/*`, and `@shared/*` all pointing to the same file, you can specify `["@shared", "@app", "@"]` to prefer the most specific alias. The first matching alias in the array will be used

#### Enhanced Vite Support
- **Improved Vite config parser** that detects aliases even when imported from external files
- **Support for complex Vite configurations** with spread operators and dynamic imports
- **Fallback detection** for common monorepo patterns (@app, @core, @library)

### üîß Changed

- **Non-intrusive debug logging** that no longer interrupts users with output panel pop-ups
- **JSON parsing improvements** for TypeScript configs with comments and trailing commas

#### Import Range Detection
- **Fixed multiline comment handling** at the beginning of files - file header comments (copyright notices, documentation blocks) are now correctly excluded from the import section and preserved during formatting

## [1.4.2] - 2025-06-09

### ‚ú® Added

#### Custom Import Sorting Within Groups
- **Added `sortOrder` configuration field** to group definitions for customizable import ordering
- **Support for two sorting modes**:
  - `sortOrder: "alphabetic"` - Standard alphabetical sorting
  - `sortOrder: ["react", "react-*", "lodash"]` - Custom pattern-based ordering with wildcards
- **Wildcard pattern support** with intelligent matching:
  - `"react-*"` matches `react-dom`, `react-router`, etc.
  - `"@app/*"` matches all internal app modules  
  - `"*test*"` matches testing-related packages
- **Fallback to alphabetic sorting** for imports not matching custom patterns
- **VS Code IntelliSense support** with comprehensive configuration schema and auto-completion

#### Enhanced Configuration Schema

- **Migration guidance** for existing configurations (zero breaking changes)

### üîÑ Backward Compatibility

#### Zero Breaking Changes
- **Existing configurations continue to work** without any modification required
